# Overview

While Jsgenesis is the team currently building the technology behind the Joystream project, we will not be around forever, and we are instead entrusting the future operation of the Joystream DAO to our community members.

The Founding Member Program formally allocates JOY tokens among some of our highest quality community members in recognition of their contributions to the project and ensures that a sufficiently large, effective and motivated community of users is ready to occupy all the different roles required to run, evolve and grow the platform on mainnet.

This repo contains important data about the state of the program, including the rules, current members, guidance on scoring and submissions, and more.

# Useful Resources
## Website and Leaderboards

Our website is the first place to check out if you would like to see the current Founding Members and our leaderboards for both regular members, and those awarded the Founding Member status.

You can also easily submit your regular activity summaries on our website using our submission form.

## Program Rules

The full rules of the Founding Member Program can be found [here](/RULES.md).

## Submission Guidance

Activity summaries can be submitted using the [form on our website](https://www.joystream.org/founding-members/form), or by sending us a PGP-signed email.

You can find out how to do either of these and the accepted formats for submission [here](/SUBMISSION-GUIDANCE.md).

## Scoring Guidance

We have also added some guidance to highlight what we consider to be some of the highest value contributions towards the growth and success of the project.

Read the non-exhaustive list of contributions and indicative point rewards. [here](/CONTRIBUTIONS.md).

## Scoring Periods

At the end of each scoring period, new Founding Members are inducted. You can read about the previous and current scoring periods here:

### Current Period

The current scoring period started on `DD/MM/YY` and will end on `DD/MM/YY`.

We have made a public announcement about the current period [here](/scoring-periods/1.md).

### Previous Period

The previous scoring period began on `DD/MM/YY` and ended on `DD/MM/YY`.

Read our comments and observations about the previous period [here](/scoring-periods/0.md).
